## Dataset

> PISA2012 dataset is a very rich dataset with 636 columns and 4885490 rows. PISA 2012 is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. This survey is about how well-prepared they are for life beyond school.


## Summary of Findings

> In this project, Analysis of datase of pisa 2012 gose throught several stages. Firstly, wrangling the dataset which is accessing, gathering, and cleaning data. Secondl, we start analysing data as Univariate which sees the distribution of math, reading and science scores. Also, the unusual distribution that we found is for each time study out of school which skewed to the right until we get the total time of study out of school and scale it as logarithmic to get normal distribution. Thired is Bivariate which explores two features together. So, we examine the relationship between scores in math, reading, and science together. So, we found all of them have positive relationships. Also, we examine the relationship between scores and gender. So, we found reading scores and females related to others. Forth stage is Multivariate which explore three feature in one plot. In this section, we examine the relationship between Scores of subjects, parents' level of education, and gender so, we don't find any relation between them except with reading scores. Also, we explore the relationship between scores and parents' level of education, and language at home. So, we found high scores for students who speak the same test language and parents has master's or doctoral. Moreover, we explore scores of subjects, language at home, and mother and father his job. we found students who speak the language as a test and their mothers mothers and fathers have full-time jobs has high scores.
